# Introduction

### What is Arkoma

Akroma is a clone of Ethereum. Akroma was created as a need to provide a development platform as an alternative to Ethereum's high fees. Unlike Ethereum; Akroma wasn't pre-mined or pre-sold. Akroma is to have a hard cap of 100 million coins. The current version of the Akroma source code does not have that cap.
